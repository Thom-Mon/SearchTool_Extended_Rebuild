* Open in Explorer: Opens the folder the file is found in, and selects it automatically.
* Filter by Extension: Offers you the option to filter by the found files extension. So the result only shows files with the selected extension
* Clear all filters: Resets all the provided filters to show the whole result again (size-Filter is not affected by this)
